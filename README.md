# PYTHON - EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS ON SPOTIFY 2023 DATASET
<p align="justify"> This repository provides a conprehensive overview of the exploratory data analysis on the Spotify 2023 Dataset. 
The focus is on Data Wrangling and Visualization and the utilization of the Pandas, Matplot, and Seaborn libraries. This task aims to analyze, visualize, 
and interpret the data to extract meaningful insights. Presented below are the different graphic visuzalizations generated by a list of various syntaxes 
in the given Python exercises.  </p>

### About the Dataset:
<p align="justify"> The <b>Spotify 2023<b/> Dataset presents an extensive collection of 2023's most popular artists and tracks.
It includes a rich set of features that go beyond what is commonly found in similar datasets, offering 
insights into each song's characteristics, popularity, and availability across various music platforms. Details include track names, 
artist names, release dates, streaming statistics, other musical attributes, as well as occurences on various music platforms and charts. </p>

# GENERAL GUIDELINES
### I. Initial Data Exploration
> Begin by familiarizing yourself with the structure of the dataset. Check for missing values and data types, and perform an initial exploration to 
understand the different features available. <br>

a.) First 5 Columns <br>

![Screen Shot 2024-11-06 at 1 45 03 PM](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d8382ba8-5422-49f2-8d3c-f043223ab795)
##### Syntax: 
```ruby
sp.head()
```
###
b.) Last 5 Columns <br>

![Screen Shot 2024-11-06 at 1 49 47 PM](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cbf42d5c-6ed3-46c8-a4e7-a05c4438a52d)
##### Syntax: 
```ruby
sp.tail()
```
###
c.) Data Types of each column <br>

![Screen Shot 2024-11-06 at 2 08 27 PM](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8fc8a74d-dee4-4893-ac25-bd4dbe8c48c3)
> Notes: The datatype int64 is a fixed-size, 64-bit signed integer type used in pandas and NumPy, with a specific range of values. Unlike Python's int datatype that is arbitruary,
  int64 has a fixed size and range.
##### Syntax: 
```ruby
sp.dtypes
```
###
d.) Missing Values <br>

![Screen Shot 2024-11-06 at 2 09 10 PM](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/61b827b9-92ab-42ba-8c8f-1775cc68cbd9)
> The output generated reveals a series where the index corresponds to the column names and the values correspond to the count of missing entries in each column.
##### Syntax: 
```ruby
sp.isnull().sum()
```
###
e.) Dataframe Shape (rows, columns) <br>

![Screen Shot 2024-11-06 at 2 10 46 PM](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5e5c92f8-cb49-4c65-b8e7-239bcfa4e6c6)
##### Syntax: 
```ruby
sp.shape
```
##
### II. Summary Statistics
> Provide summary statistics to give an overview of key metrics such as the number of streams, release dates, and musical attributes (e.g., BPM, danceability). <br>

### Important!
Note that some values in the streams column are non-numerical. Hence, data cleaning is required to convert these non-numerical values to numerical format in order to display the 
number of streams accurately.
##### Syntax: 
```ruby
sp['streams'].unique()
sp['streams'] = pd.to_numeric(sp['streams'], errors='coerce')
```
### Overview of streams, released day, bpm, and danceability (%)

![Screen Shot 2024-11-06 at 2 23 38 PM](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2ad1bec3-c3d2-4152-8242-eadb469e35bc)
##### Syntax: 
```ruby
summary_stats = sp[['streams', 'released_day', 'bpm', 'danceability_%']].describe()
```
### Null values of the ff. variables

![Screen Shot 2024-11-06 at 2 25 24 PM](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/af5f4a48-1740-4902-ae92-47b003c841fd)
##### Syntax: 
```ruby
print("Missing values in 'streams':", sp['streams'].isnull().sum())
print("Missing values in 'released day':", sp['released_day'].isnull().sum())
print("Missing values in 'bpm':", sp['bpm'].isnull().sum())
print("Missing values in 'danceability (%)':", sp['danceability_%'].isnull().sum())
```
##
### III. Trends
> Use appropriate visualizations (e.g., bar charts, histograms, scatter plots) to uncover trends and patterns in the data.
Ensure that your plots are well-labeled and easy to interpret. <br>

### Top 10 Songs by Total Streams

> Lorem et ipsum  Lorem et ipsum  Lorem et ipsum  Lorem et ipsum  Lorem et ipsum  Lorem et ipsum
##### Syntax: 
```ruby
# Top 10 songs by streams 
top_10_songs = sp.filter(items = ['track_name','streams'], axis = 1)

# Sorting the values by stream in decsending order
top_10_songs = top_10_songs.sort_values(by = 'streams',ascending = False).head(10)

# Plot Horizontal Bar graph
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
sns.barplot(x='streams', y='track_name', data=top_10_songs, palette='coolwarm')
plt.title('Top 10 Songs by Total Streams')
plt.xlabel('Total Streams')
plt.ylabel('Song Title')
plt.tight_layout(pad=2.0)
plt.show()
```
### Top 10 Artists by Total Streams

> Lorem et ipsum  Lorem et ipsum  Lorem et ipsum  Lorem et ipsum  Lorem et ipsum  Lorem et ipsum
##### Syntax: 
```ruby
# Top 10 songs by streams 
top_10_songs = sp.filter(items = ['track_name','streams'], axis = 1)

# Sorting the values by stream in decsending order
top_10_songs = top_10_songs.sort_values(by = 'streams',ascending = False).head(10)

# Plot Horizontal Bar graph
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
sns.barplot(x='streams', y='track_name', data=top_10_songs, palette='coolwarm')
plt.title('Top 10 Songs by Total Streams')
plt.xlabel('Total Streams')
plt.ylabel('Song Title')
plt.tight_layout(pad=2.0)
plt.show()
```
##
### IV. Correlation/Relationship
> Investigate correlations between different variables and provide insights based on your findings.
Explore relationships between streams and other musical characteristics like tempo, energy, or playlists. <br>

### Correlation Matrix between all Variables

> Lorem et ipsum  Lorem et ipsum  Lorem et ipsum  Lorem et ipsum  Lorem et ipsum  Lorem et ipsum
##### Syntax: 
```ruby
# Select following datatypes to include in matrix
numeric_sp = sp.select_dtypes(include=['float64' ,'int64'])

# Calculate the correlation matrix
correlation_matrix = numeric_sp.corr()

# Plot the correlation matrix using Seaborn
plt.figure(figsize=(14, 12))
sns.heatmap(correlation_matrix, annot=True, cmap='coolwarm', fmt=".2f")
plt.title('Correlation Matrix between All Variables in Dataset')
plt.show()
```
